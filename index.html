<h1>Artificial Intelligence</h1>
<h3>What is AI?</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;">Artificial intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, is intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems, as opposed to the natural intelligence of living beings. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software which enable machines to perceive their environment and uses learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.[1] Such machines may be called AIs.</p>
<h3>Goals Of AI?</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;">The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into sub-problems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.[a]</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li style="text-align:left;">Reasoning and problem solving    </li>
    <li style="text-align:left;">Knowledge representation    </li>
    <li style="text-align:left;">Planning and decision making    </li>
    <li style="text-align:left;">Learning</li>
    <li style="text-align:left;">Natural language processing    </li>
    <li style="text-align:left;">Perception</li>
    <li style="text-align:left;">Social intelligence    </li>
    <li style="text-align:left;">General intelligence    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Types of artificial intelligence</h3>
<p style="text-align:left;">Artificial intelligence can be organized in several ways, depending on stages of development or actions being performed. </p>
<ol>
    <li style="text-align:left;">Reactive machines: Limited AI that only reacts to different kinds of stimuli based on preprogrammed rules. Does not use memory and thus cannot learn with new data. IBMâ€™s Deep Blue that beat chess champion Garry Kasparov in 1997 was an example of a reactive machine.</li>
<br>
       <li style="text-align:left;"> Limited memory: Most modern AI is considered to be limited memory. It can use memory to improve over time by being trained with new data, typically through an artificial neural network or other training model. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, is considered limited memory artificial intelligence.
</li><br><li style="text-align:left;">
        Theory of mind: Theory of mind AI does not currently exist, but research is ongoing into its possibilities. It describes AI that can emulate the human mind and has decision-making capabilities equal to that of a human, including recognizing and remembering emotions and reacting in social situations as a human would. 
        </li><br><li style="text-align:left;">
        Self aware: A step above theory of mind AI, self-aware AI describes a mythical machine that is aware of its own existence and has the intellectual and emotional capabilities of a human. Like theory of mind AI, self-aware AI does not currently exist.</li>
</li>
    </ol>
